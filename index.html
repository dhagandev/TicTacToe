					Welcome to Tic-Tac-Toe! The game is very simple, get three of your pieces in a row before the other player. The first player will always be represented by an X and the second by an O. You have a 3 x 3 grid to place your pieces. Once an empty cell has been filled you cannot put a piece there. You ready to try? Press a button to begin!
